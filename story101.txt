You rack your mind for a magical spell. The slime gets one free hit upon you
as you do this; you lose 1 HEALTH. However, you find what you are looking for, 
and you cast it without much consideration. The slime undergoes a huge change...
into a toadstool. Very nice! (+10 points for style.) You lose, however, an
additional 3 HEALTH for this feat.
