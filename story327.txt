You cast one last glance at the fallen dragon and the dark elf, before racing
down the stairs. Things burn and fall, but with the desperate will of a survivor
you race outside.

In your shame, you run away from this mansion, not even looking back as you hear
it collapse to the ground. Ignoring the screams of those burning within, you
survive, but in the end you weren't cut out for being a hero. The tale of your
quest will never be carried down to your descendants.
**THE END?**
