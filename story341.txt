Shayla staggers back from your last strike. You can tell that she is weakening,
as she is breathing heavily from the fight. Her magically-summoned knives return
to the Void.
"Curse you, human." she hisses. "But behold! The might of my birthright, lost
after so many years!"
She pulls out a simple, golden ring from her pocket. It is too far to read the
inscription from here, but you are almost certain of what it reads. Shayla
confirms your fears.
"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them."
Her determination keeping her from death, she grins at you. You understand now.
If that artifact is her 'birthright,' then she must have been a descendant of 
the previous owner. The daughter of the Dark One himself.
"Mortal, fear the might of the 'One Ring'!"
Shayla slips the ring upon a finger, and vanishes from your sight.
(CAN YOU SEE THE ENDING?)
