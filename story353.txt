You are resting on something soft. Half awake, it is a while before you realise
that it is somebody's theighs, before you hastily get up. Turning around, you
find that it is Shayla. She smiles, a warm smile, the one you remember.

You find yourself staring at her eyes. They are the colour of amber once more,
not red, and you find yourself greatly relieved by this development. Under your
intense scrutiny, Shayla looks away, her fringe covering her eyes.

"Are you ok?" you ask.
It is a while before she speaks.
"Yes."

Your eyes are distracted by a golden glint in the grass. It is the One Ring, now
shattered into pieces. It is finally over, and you get to your feet, before
reaching a hand out for the dark elf.

"Come on."
