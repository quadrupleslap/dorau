The door is not locked. You open it, prepared for anything.

The room you have entered is grand, despite the dark exterior of the mansion. A
black chandelier hangs from the ceiling, casting a dark glow on the interior of 
the room. To your right, a staircase runs up, gargoyles adorning the banister.
A plain red carpet covers the floor. There are patches of blue on it, however,
in strange locations that don't seem to discern any meaning. Apart from the 
door you have just entered by, there is only one in the opposite side of the 
room.
Do you:
Climb the staircase? (1)
Open the other door? (2)
