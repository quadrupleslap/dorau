+Booze
+Doubloon (4)
At last, you make it to the Sky Pirate's ship. However, the state of it is not 
what you expected.

The ship is obviously damaged. Fallen to earth, half of the ship is just 
destroyed. A few bodies lie upon the ground around you, and you inspect them. 
They are Sky Pirates; most have an expression of pure horror upon their faces, 
and some have limbs torn off or are disembowled.

You come to the last corpse, and to your suprise the person coughs. It seems he
is not completely dead. Upon seeing you, he mutters, almost as if to himself.
"No... not the elf! Northward she went... monster... monster...."
The man stops, and you check his pulse. Dead.
It seems as if you came here a few days too late: why does this happen to you?
You pursue these pirates for so long, and when you finally get here you find 
that she has been taken by monsters. Great.

You loot some of the bodies. There is nothing of interest, save 4 gold doubloons
and a bottle of booze. You can drink the booze at any time but combat by typing
'BOOZE' into the 'Command' bar.
Now, will you: 
Enter the destroyed ship to take a look? (82)
Immediately set out towards Shayla? (11)
