You cast a powerful summoning spell. From a magic pentagram summoned in the air,
a spirit fox rushes out. Although the shapeshifter swats at the fox, the claws
pass through without any visible damage. However, the fox can wound the 
shapeshifter; this is obvious when its first bite draws beads of blood. Howling
in pain, frustration at being denied of a potential meal, the shapeshifter 
escapes. You return the spirit fox to where it came from, but this spell is 
not at all easy; lose 6 HEALTH from this. After you spend a bit of time to 
catch your breath, you proceed on your journey.
