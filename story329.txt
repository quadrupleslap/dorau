The shadow lands. You find, to your horror, that Weetbix is not slain. Or
rather, that its soul has not left it yet. The skeletal dragon before you can
be nothing else but the Weetbix you fought just minutes ago. The dead dragon
roars out at you, green necrofire foaming at the mouth.

Weetbix, skeletal forme SKILL:† HEALTH:14
¤WORLD BOSS¤

Weetbix surrounds its body with a layer of green necrofire. This fire grants it
a small 'armour save' chance. However, normal hits now deal one damage to it,
as it has lost its armour. Also, every five combat rounds, the dragon will
breathe a stream of necrofire at you, dealing 4 damage. You cannot afford this
to drag on! Luckily, just as in life, Weetbix's attacks are too strong for 
itself to handle, and it deals 1 damage to itself per combat round.

You cannot run; you will be scorched to ashes by its necrofire, if you ever
attempt to.
