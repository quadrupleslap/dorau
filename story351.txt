Lilac's words come to mind.
"... it is not her fault."
As Shayla leaps at you, in a desperate last gamble, you do not attack her.
Instead, swinging the Callandor in a wide arc, you bring the weapon to the ring.
Perhaps it was divine intervention that you were so accurate in your attack, or
not. Either way, there is no saying what happened afterwards, so amazing it
could not be accurately described with words.

The Callandor, in your god-blessed vision being a shining blue dragon, smashes
straight into the core of the ring. The tendrils of black and gold previously
wrapped around Shayla detatch. You watch as they move to swipe at the dragon,
and it is like an intricate dance as the Callandor twists and turns to avoid 
them. As the dragon continues to strike at the ring, it cracks, then shatters,
before an explosion of energy forces you backwards. You hit your head on
something as you fly, and knock yourself out.
