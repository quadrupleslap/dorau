<L 1
The person walking towards you is a girl who looks to be about twelve. What 
catches your eye is her hair and eyes. The hair is in twintails, and the eyes
look like those of manga characters. But that is not the main reason.
Even from a distance, you can see that her hair and eyes are an exotic light 
purple in colour, a shade that could be best described as 'lilac.' Something 
leads you to think that both are actually real.

You realise that you are staring. The girl, noticing you, looks at you 
disinterestedly.
"What do you want?" she demands.
Will you reply:
"Oh, nothing, I was just passing by..." (67)
"Teach me, sensei, the art of magic." (127)
"Why are your hair and eyes purple?" (277)
