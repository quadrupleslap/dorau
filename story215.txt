+Map to the Golden Monkey
You pick the lock after a lot of hand wriggling. Where did you even get this 
skill? The lock clicks, and you open the chest. Unfortunately, it is trapped; 
you are shot by a poisoned dart, and lose 4 HEALTH.

What is in the chest, however, may make it completely worth it. You pull out an
old piece of parchment. 'X' marks the spot, and what's more, the spot is 
located in the general direction of where you are going! A scribble dictates 
that the 'X' is the location of a 'great object.'  At least, that's what it 
should say.

You add the map to your inventory. In the future, you may be able to make a 
detour to claim this treasure.
