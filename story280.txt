You cast a spell, and a blue shield appears in front of you, temporarily 
protecting you from damage. Lose 3 HEALTH.

Kerrigan laughs.
"Psionic energy? None is more masterful at it than ME!"

The shield before you suddenly shatters, and you fly backwards into a wall. Lose
1 HEALTH. Kerrigan jumps at you again, preparing to reengage.

You can still escape! Just do it! (Seriously.)
