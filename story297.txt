The helm jukes your sword, rolling to the side. Instead, you stab a hole in the 
floorboards. You go for a second attack, but it is too late. The armour has 
reformed itself, for a second attack. It is still cracked from your previous
attack, however, and lacks its lance, which it did not manage to pick up.
Kicking its weapon down the stairs, you must destroy this animated opponent once
more!
