>S 2
The old man says a single word, and with the sound of a toilet flushing, a huge
boar appears. It is actually huge. Like, actually. If you could kill it, there
would be enough pork for a whole month to gorge yourself on. However, the old 
man first sets down some rules.

"You can only fight with your bare hands, and cannot kill the boar, only subdue
it."

How the hell does he think you can subdue this thing? As you are about to 
whine at the man, the boar lowers its head. You try to draw your weapon, but a 
eyeless look from the old man of the forest is enough to stop you.

Boar SKILL:8 HEALTH:5

The boar is quite weak, for some reason, but you are fighting with your bare 
hands. This is a horrible battle, even worse than when you had a suitcase. You 
temporarily lose 2 SKILL for this battle, and also only deal 1 damage for every
successful hit. You can't run or use magic; the forest guardian dude is making
sure of that.
