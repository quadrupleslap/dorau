"Unhand me, grey-bearded loon!" you savagely cry.
The mariner looks at you for the first time, then draws a huge sea anchor from
what was the air next to him just mere seconds ago.
"I SHOT THE ALBATROSS!" he screams.
Put the Ancient Mariner to rest!

The anchor is really heavy, and will deal 3 damage to you every time it hits. In
the meantime, the mariner will sprout random gibberish lines from his poem, 
lowering your SKILL by 1 for this battle only, as you will find it hard to 
concentrate. The mariner is vengeful; you will not be able to run from this 
battle!
@Magic& The mariner's gibberish also causes you to be unable to concentrate on
@Magic& any magic.
