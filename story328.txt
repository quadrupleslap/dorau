>H 4
You unchain Shayla, by bashing the locks open, and carrying her princess style
down the burning mansion. Wooden planks fall around you, the fire burns hot,
blocking some doors, and you almost die of smoke inhalation, but you make it 
out. Of course, running down burning buildings have their consequences, and you
lose 4 HEALTH. You prop the dark elf in a sitting position against a tree, and
wipe your forehead. Everything is over.

...Or is it? As the mansion collapses, a shadow blots out the moon.

(CAN YOU SEE THE ENDING?)
