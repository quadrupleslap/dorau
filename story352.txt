Lilac is in your dreams. You know that it is a dream, as the world around you
keeps on changing. One minute, it is the city from which you began your journey,
then the next, you find yourself upon the yellow brick road again. The purple
haired girl beckons you to follow her, and you do so.

You eventually reach a location that you have never visited before. You are in
a large courtyard. There is a raised pedestral in the centre of this, and a 
boulder upon that. Lilac speaks, but you cannot hear her. You step up the
stairs.

Callandor is suddenly in your gauntlet hand. You reach the stone, finally, take
one last look at the weapon in your grasp, before thrusting it into the stone
with all your might. The gauntlet, stuck upon your sword hand, vanishes with a
flash of blue light.

You turn, and Lilac is before you.
"This is where the Callandor belongs, in Tear." she speaks. "Amother will need
to claim it, to fulfil an inescapable destiny of theirs. Do not fear, however,
as the sword recognises you, and acknowledges you as its master. When you need
it again, it will return to you once more."
You nod. The words feel abstract, as if it is talking about a different 'you.'
"Now wake, hero." she whispers.

You open your eyes.
