As the pirate falls, a whistle pierces the battlefield. Instantly, the remaining
pirates, grabbing valuables or hostages, rappel to the top of the ship. The
ship, in record time, sails away from the scene of the crime.

You look around, finding that you are the only living person left in the square.
None of the bodies, upon inspection, resembles Shayla, and so you deduct that 
she was taken.

You rummage through the bodies, picking up the scimitar, a set of lockpicks and
a bottle of booze. You can drink the booze at any time, but during combat. It 
heals up to 4 HEALTH in total, and contains one dose. (Type 'BOOZE' in the 
'Command' bar to drink it.)

Now, there are 3 paths out of Execution Square that does not go back to your job
interview. To your left is Ruby Street, before you is Emerald Avenue and to your
right is Sapphire Road. Do you:
Enter Ruby Street? (1)
Enter Emerald Avenue? (2)
Enter Sapphire Road? (3)
