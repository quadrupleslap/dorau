THE BACKGROUND STORY
You are a student at SBHS (That's Silver Badge Holy Shrine, mind you.) Or,
rather, you were. Graduating at the top of the class with an ATAR of 99.95, as
the top student in swordfighting in the state, you are the person everybody 
wanted to be.

However, upon leaving the shrine, your luck took a turn for the worse. An
ancient and powerful family, the Mitsubishis, secured you as their heir's 
swordsfighting teacher. The pay was good, and for a few weeks you were content.

One day, you left your home to buy groceries. It was on this day that a fateful
encounter changed your life. As you passed a park, you saw the heir to the 
Mitsubishi family, Carsgud Mitsubishi, playing with his friends. At least, that
was your first impression. To your suprise and horror, Carsgud had drawn his
wooden sword, and was cruelly beating up the smallest kid as the others watched
and laughed!

Your strong sense of justice could not let this go by. You reprimanded the young
Mitsubishi, and sent him home. 

The next day, you were fired.

And so our dramatic story begins with your job interview...
