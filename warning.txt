Before you play the game, you must agree to the following conditions:
*NEVER OPEN STORY/MONSTER/DECISION FILES UNTIL YOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE 'TRUE'
ENDING, OR EVEN READ THE CODE. (You'll know that from the text it spits out 
after completion. I know some of you will begin to read the code after this,
but I made sure to make it as illiterate as possible while still knowing what I
was doing.)
*THE AUTHOR/ MAJOR PROGRAMMER WILL MOST LIKELY NOT BE UPDATING THIS IN THE
FUTURE. SO DON'T ASK HIM TO. (It was for free, you know.)
*NEVER OPEN, OR TAMPER WITH THE SAVE FILES. SERIOUSLY. (Don't blame me if your
file screws up. Also, it's really boring to just win. Really.)
*NEVER DISTRIBUTE THIS AROUND. AND IF YOU DO, DON'T GIVE IT TO RAMACHANDRAN.
REALLY.
