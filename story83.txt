You bypass the door quite easily. It's nice that the door jammer works so well!
The room before you is a mess hall. The chairs and tables are all there, but 
there is no food. Other than this, the room is bare.

There are three doors that lead out of this room to the South, West and North.
Will you go:
West? (56)
South? (116)
North? (314)
