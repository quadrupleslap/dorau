You move to the trinkets store. Upon close inspection, most of the trinkets are
just cheap imitations, or trash, plastics painted over again. However, some of
the objects are actually genuine, or at least you suspect them to be.

The person manning the store, upon seeing your resplendent suit and tie,
mistakes you to be someone big.
"Welcome!" he says. "I advise you purchase this beautiful ring for any female in
your family here. I guarantee they will love it..."
Ignoring him, do you want a:
Pretty Amulet? ($19.00)
Ring of Frost? ($30.00)
Shiny Chain? ($29.05)

If you would like to purchase anything, go to '190'.
Else, do you want to:
Visit the essential items store? (214)
Visit the potions and poultices store? (80)
Or leave the market area? (167)
