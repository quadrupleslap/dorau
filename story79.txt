<H 4
You find some salted meat in a corner of the room, and decide to take it on your
journey. You then decide, emboldened by your luck, to taste one of the fruits
that look like a banana. To your suprise, it tastes like pineapples, and you are
quite happy to chow down on a few of them. You regain up to 4 points of lost
HEALTH in this room.

Food you take with you can be consumed. As long as you are not in combat, or 
otherwise occupied, (or dead,) you may consume provisions for a instant recovery
of 4 HEALTH. You can do so by typing 'EAT' into the 'Command' bar. There is 
enough meat for two meals.
Now, you can: 
Go North. (56)
Go East. (116)
