You step over the now inanimate body and go over to the table. You scan the 
letters upon it. Most are addressed to a person called 'Adelaide,' but a few
are of interest. One, in particular, catches your eye. It is not so much a
letter, but a diary entry.

'21/xx/xx
Oh, the horror! She is coming. I knew it was a bad idea to take her! Those 
monsters... I can hear the screams of my crew outside.... equal to Echidna, the 
mother of monsters. They have completely boarded the ship. Please, whomever 
reads this, bury me in Edel, my home town. Adelaide, I wish I could have seen 
you again, despite becoming a good-for-nothing pirate. May god save my s.....'

The parts replaced by '...'s are smeared with blood. At the end, it just trails
off.

You leave, with more question than you came here with.
