"What are you on about? I'm an elf..." you say, desperately pulling on your 
ears.

You are clearly NOT an elf. Elves value the truth (or, like all fey, half lies)
above all other virtues. This is in part because they cannot lie, only distort.
Hearing this from you, especially in a high pitched voice displaying no 
knowledge AT ALL in the elven, reinforces their negative image of humans, and
at the same time insults them greatly. If you had done biology in high school,
you would know elves have no moral problems in consuming human flesh....
