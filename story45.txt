-Watch
Outside the walls of the city, you feel that even the air is sweeter. However,
despite your upbringing, you know fully well that the wild is lawless. In fact,
to your misfortune, you find that your watch is missing! You can't even tell
the time anymore.
Which way do you think the pirate ship went? Do you try to pursue it:
North? (85)
East? (166)
South? (180)
It probably didn't go West. You know, cause of air turbulence. It was on the 
weather forecast today.
