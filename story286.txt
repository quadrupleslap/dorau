You cast a spell, one of the five forbidden magical arts. As the monster winds
back for the next swing, you place your hand on its chest. It proceeds to throw
its fist at you. Literally. The stitches have come apart, and you duck below 
this attack.

All the stitches holding its body together fall apart. You watch with horror as
the monster comes apart in lumps of flesh and gore. Consumed by nausea, both 
from the horrid sight of such a death and the effects of the magic upon your
human body, you retch. Lose 7 HEALTH for dabbling in the forbidden arts. Wiping
your hand along your mouth, you take a look around at the lab.
