Sapphire Road is a place for the rich. The people have bling, the cars have 
bling, the houses have bling, even the seagulls have bling. The problem is, you
don't have enough bling, so the guards stationed there (with their bling) turn
you away.
"Come back when you're richer!" one laughs.
You consider punching him in the face, but really, you don't want to go to 
jail.
Now, you can either enter:
Ruby Street (1)
Or Emerald Avenue (2)
