The man claps once, and the huge boar disappears from sight. He gives out a
small 'hmph' noise in disappointment. 
"Go on." he says, as you cautiously continue on your way.

You have taken no more than about five minutes before you are stopped again. 
Many pointly-eared humanoids surround you with their bows nocked, ready to 
pincushion you at the slightest sign of ill-intent. These are elves, relatives
of Shayla, though the two races both hate each other. (Maybe you shouldn't have
made that comment about hippy elves before...)

she is some sort of high-ranked authority in an elven hierachy.

"I just want to get out of this forest." (146)
"I come in peace, to offer you gifts!" (195)
"What are you on about? I'm an elf..." (26)
