You cast a magical spell, one of the 6th tier that most humans rarely ever see.
Magical pentagrams appear in the air around you. The alien gasps.
"I have never seen technology like this!" it says in suprise.
A creature, made seemingly of fire and brimstone, appears before you. You 
collapse from the effort of such magic. Summoning a fire demon from even the 
lesser planes of Hell is tiring enough, but the one before you is a middle-tier
demonic overlord! You lose 8 HEALTH for this feat.

The demon gazes at the alien, who attempts a futile charge at it. With a single
fist, the hellspawn crushes both lance and person. It then turns its  eyes upon
you, and you are sure that, at that moment, the creature is no longer under your
control. You must attempt a banishing! But can you do it, being so weak?
