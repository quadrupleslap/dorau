It is late when you set up camp for the night. The fire casts strange shadows
upon the grass, and you sleep uneasily.

You wake up invigorated in the morning, despite this. Regain 2 HEALTH. Marching
onwards, you find that the land around you begins to change for the worse; the
odd tree is gnarled and leafless, and even animal tracks begin to disappear. The
grass around begins to be brown in colour, then blackened, before finally not
growing at all. Something is very wrong with this land.

@Map to the Golden Monkey& You notice that you can take a short detour to make it to the 'X' on the map you
@Map to the Golden Monkey& have managed to acquire. However, for the time being....
@Map to the Golden Monkey&
Your interest is piqued by a deer, grazing innocently upon the... dirt. Why is 
there a random deer here in this forsaken land?
Now, will you:
@Map to the Golden Monkey& Go towards the 'X' on the map? (47)
Investigate the animal? (335)
Continue onwards? (191)
