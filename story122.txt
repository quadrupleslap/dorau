You enter a very large room. The place is luxurious, and the interior gives off
a sense of wealth that even a non-alien scrub like you can sense. In a sofa,
facing away from you, lounges and alien. He gives off an air of superiority,
even when watching an anime with magic girls and a cat-like alien that collects
energy from little girls. It seems strangely familiar...

Suddenly, the doors close themselves, and you are shocked as your cloak that
makes people invisible stops making you invisible. Perhaps you've stopped being
a person? The alien calmly turns off his TV, and slowly faces you.

"Welcome. I have been expecting you..." it begins to launch into a meaningless
monologue, a must-have for every sub-boss and above serious villain.
Will you:
Allow it to finish, before doing anything? (1)
Jump in and stab the **** out of it? (2)
