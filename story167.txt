-Mariner's Crossbow
+*Mariner's Crossbow*
You give the dwarf your crossbow. The dwarf looks at it, then goes down into
his home. Shortly, he returns.
"I have removed the curse upon this weapon. Also, I reoiled it."
You take the weapon, and hope he's not scamming you (like that time that shifty
Chinese man sold you a pillow that cures old age.)

You thank the dwarf, despite your misgivings, and leave.
