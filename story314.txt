You finally arrive on the roof, and find who you were looking for. Shayla is
chained to a cross, unconscious. You move to rush over, but are pushed back by
a powerful gale of wind.

A black dragon lands between you and Shayla. You stare in disbelief. Nobody 
could ever survive the might of Lord Helix, but...
"I AM WEETBIX!" it roars. "EVEN ST GEORGE WAS NOT ENOUGH TO MATCH ME! AND YOU
THINK I WILL BE DEFEATED BY A MERE MOLLUSK?"
Lord Helix was just a mere mollusk to it?

Do you:
Use something from your bag? (1)
Charge the dragon 'Weetbix'? (2)
