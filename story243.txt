"I am expected." you reply.
"Ah, Lord Morgoth, I presume?" he says. "Follow me."
You follow him, past a room with a dark red carpet, into a very lavish waiting 
room. The sofa is soft, and made of fine red velvet. Tapestries depicting 
various images, crafted with the skills ofa true master, line the walls, and to 
the West a fireplace crackles heartily. The table has a range of refreshments 
for your consumption.
"Make yourself at home." the hunchback says. "I apologise for the delays, but 
the master will be here soon."
As the hunchback leaves, you survey the room. There are two doors; one in the
Northern wall, and one to the South, which will return you to the room you came
by.
Do you:
Consume some of the refreshments? (1)
Go North, through the door? (2)
Go through the Southern door? (3)
Wait patiently for the 'master?' (4)
