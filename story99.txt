You enter a room. The door is on the opposite wall, but your movements are 
impeded by your surroundings. In fact, the floor you are standing on runs for 
about 30 centimetres, before dropping in level drastically. You look down, and
see a layer of slimy water. Ladders lead down into this sludge, and back up on
the other side.
