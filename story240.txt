You look around for a way to enter, but duck quickly into a bush upon seeing a
guard. Complete in black armour, with a visor covering his face and holding a
halberd, you don't really want to attack him, in the case he sets off the alarm.
You return to the door, once he walks past, and decide you should just hurry up
and go in. You open the door.
