+Excaliber
The sword is very, very heavy, but you think you can carry it. However, it may

"That sword is Excaliber. Use it well." the satyr then disappears into his hut.
You strap this 'Excaliber' to your back, shrugging at the randomness of your 
adventure. Maybe you'll be able to summon the Saber class servant next.
