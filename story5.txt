You exit from the building where you took your job interview, gasping for fresh
air. Of course you failed it; you couldn't even remember the name of the cousin
of the uncle of the grandfather of the daughter of the president twice removed,
found on page 192, Chapter 3.2 of the code of conduct. You take a quick look 
around at your surroundings. There is a McDonald's place to your left, competing
with the KFC right next to it. To your right is a road that leads to Execution
Square. Where would you like to go?
