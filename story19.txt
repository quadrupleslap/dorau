It turns out the dark elf is not a bad person, once you get to know her. Her 
name is Shayla, and as you two continue on your journey, she tells you of her
quest.
"We will soon come to a portal, guarded by a ferocious creature none has 
returned from alive. It is essential that I pass through the portal to reclaim
my birthright."

Her story is cut short by a booming voice.
"WHO DARES FACE THE WRATH OF WEETBIX?"

Before you stands a huge dragon, wings blotting out the sky. It seems as if the 
dragon is draining the light from around it with its black scales. The creature
considers the two of you with malevolant eyes.
