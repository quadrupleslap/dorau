>S 2
The two of you race towards the portal, and leap in. At the point of contact, 
you close your eyes...

When you open them again, you see to your amazement that you are back in
Execution Square! The elves, dwarves and pixies stare at you in amazement.
"How... but yer just fell in!" a dwarf exclaims.
Their amazement is cut short, though, by an object that blacks out the rays of 
the sun. You look up to the sky - a great flying ship, bearing the signature
skull and crossbones of the Sky Pirates!

Ropes extend from the ship, and you hear frantic screaming around you. However,
you do not have time to consider those unlucky victims; a pirate has descended 
before you, brandishing a scimitar. You must fight the pirate.

Sky Pirate SKILL:6 HEALTH:6

This is your first battle, and you fight at -2 SKILL with your awesome suitcase.
You will find that the 'Command' bar has become an 'Action' bar. Type 'A' into
this action bar to attack, and 'H' to make a heavy attack. When the battle is 
over, the 'Command' bar will return. Just press Enter to continue after a battle
is over.
