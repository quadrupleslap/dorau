Everything is over. You crawl over to Shayla and look at her face. It is 
peaceful in death, like the Shayla you knew just after falling down the hole in
what seems like a lifetime ago. You close her eyes, before prising the ring off
her finger. The ring whispers dark secrets to you, secrets of immortality and
power and greed and lust, but you dig a shallow hole, and bury it. Why would
you succumb to the temptation of world domination, when it means even more blood
on your hands? You are sure that someone will find this ring again in the 
future, but preferably in a distant future where you are long dead.

Merciful rain pours down upon you, concealing your tears.
**THE END.**
