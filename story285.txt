You open the door. Inside is a labatory, filled with scientific equipment and
stuff. However, you're more concerned by a creature standing in the centre of 
the room. Presumably what was causing the breathing sound, it is a patchwork 
monster, sewn together from many different body parts of different creatures. In
its right claw, it holds a human corpse, in a white laboratory coat. That is
probably the 'Dr.Fredrick,' now deceased.

Upon seeing you, the creature throws down the human body, and turns fo face you.
Uttering a horrid snort-snarl from its sorry excuse for a mouth, it lumbers 
towards you. You must fight the monster!

You cannot escape in this moment, as there is nowhere else to go.
