The 'X' on the map is located near a triangle. Now that you are here, you find
that it was just a symbol to represent the pyramid before you.

You walk up to the pyramid warily. There seems to be nothing resembling a 
treasure here... and it hit you. It was buried, wasn't it. You facepalm at your
stupidity. How could you forget that all pirates bury their treasure? So why 
didn't you bring a shovel?

Your silent monologue is cut short by a booming voice.
"Ah, a challenger! None have challenged my champion for many centries. I think
he needs a little oiling now. Anyways, if you can successfully defeat him, I 
will convey my blessings upon you. If you can't, you will die."

Wait, don't you get a choice in this? As you are about to protest, something big
rises out of the sands. The sand stream off its body, and you find that it is 
a dog headed man. It is obviously a statue; it has been 
buried for ages, come on! The statue steps forward, and pulls out a HUGE sickle
from the sand next to him.

Anubis SKILL:8 HEALTH:15

You are quite lucky that Anubis is very old and has not been oiled for a while 
now. Its movements are slow and out of sync, otherwise it would probably be a 
SKILL:14 HEALTH:34 or something.

A green barrier forms around you and the statue. Crud. No running now, I guess.
