>S 1
You climb down. Fully expecting to drop into the liquid, you are mildly 
suprised when it is found to be solid. You are really suprised when the slime
you are standing on rears up to attack you!

Jelly Slime SKILL:7 HEALTH:18

You fight this battle at 1 less SKILL, due to awkward positioning. Also, due to
your current location, you unfortunately cannot escape, as the slime bobs up and
down to disorientate you. Luckily, the creature only deals one damage to you
for every hit it gets, although you will be slimy for days afterwards....
