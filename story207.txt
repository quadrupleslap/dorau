+造Callandor造
<H 5
Excaliber is nothing like what it once was; the resplendent emerald and diamonds
once upon its crossguard are now gone. Instead, that area is now shaped like a 
dragon; the two wings making up the crossguard, tail wrapped around the hilt 
and head resting upon the blade. Where the Excaliber was once gold, this is now
silver; the entire weapon being a translucent, almost transparent, silver-blue 
in colour, the blade slightly curved when it was once straight. Lilac offers you 
the weapon, and you take it. A surge of power runs through you, and a wispish
silver gauntlet materialises upon your sword hand. Curiously, you know that it 
does not come off. Restore 5 HEALTH.

"This weapon shall serve you well. It is the 'sword that is not a sword,' the 
Callandor."

From now on, you will use the Callandor in battle. The weapon is a magic 
conduit. Whenever you cast a spell, you take 3 less damage than it says so, even
to a total damage of 0 (but not below.) The sword will NOT give any SKILL 
bonuses, like Excaliber, but it will deal 3 damage instead on a normal hit, and 
five on a heavy. Additionally, its unique power as the 'sword that is not a 
sword' allows it to shatter magical artifacts. This may become relevant later 
on.

Lilac grants you a final clue about your destiny.
"Hero, in the end, remember that it is not her fault."
"Now go, and don't look back."

You leave, not taking a single glance backwards.
