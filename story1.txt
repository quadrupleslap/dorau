Yes... hmm... I see. So THAT is your stats as a person. Pretty pathetic, if you
ask me.

...

It seems that you may not know how to view your own stats. This omniscient
narrator that has undoubtedly insulted your life skills will now show you how to
view your own stats. This is not a good way to start. (Unless you are a
masochist.)

NOTE: Type in 'STATS' (in any combination of caps and non caps) into the
'Command' Bar you have been unwittingly using. Your SKILL, HEALTH and LUCK 
should pop up.

SKILL is a measure of... well, skill. It determines how likely you are to 
succeed in something. If you couldn't determine this, you don't deserve a high
SKILL value.

HEALTH is so obvious that I'm not going to even say anything. Needless to say,
when your health hits 0, YOU DIE. Dying is bad for the heart.

LUCK measures how lucky you are. Really.
