The magic within you unfortunately backfires with the technology around you. The
cloak that makes people invisible is no longer making you invisible. You see
understanding dawn on the alien's faes, and you would facepalm if you were not
fighting for your life. Lose 1 HEALTH, and the SKILL bonus for being invisible.
However, you think that the cloak is not destroyed, but rather just for this one
fight, useless.
Also, you can no longer escape.
