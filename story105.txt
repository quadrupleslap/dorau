You have unwittingly stumbled upon a barrack in the interior of the ship. Many
aliens are training within, and you give a sigh of relief that you cannot be 
seen. There is no way you could ever beat so many of these creatures up! You see
a sparkle near one of the beds, and a door located near you. You hope that the 
aliens are not observant enough to notice a door randomly opening and closing.
Will you:
Go through the Northern door? (300)
Go through the Western door? (68)
Investigate the sparkle you saw? (206)
