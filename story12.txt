-NOKIA Brick
You wake up in a strange land. Confused at first, you then remember everything,
and are suprised that, not only are you alive, but also unharmed. You check your
equipment. While you fell, the suitcase opened, and you lost all your documents.
However, your suitcase is undamaged. The only thing destroyed is your brick 
NOKIA, and you chuck the now-useless phone away.

@Maccas& Unfortunately, the food you bought lies at your feet. Unless you want to
@Maccas& eat dirt burgers, it is inedible. Unlucky!

You stiffen from the feeling of a sudden sword as your neck.
"Turn around, slowly." a voice orders.
Will you:
	Comply? (138)
	Spin and go for a low kick, sweeping your attacker off their feet? (68)
	Use your latent psychic powers to break their sword? (195)
	Run screaming like a headless chicken? (307)
