Arcane symbols appear in the air around you. You can feel brilliant wings unfurl
on your back. Light condenses in the air above the night beholder. Forming the
shape of a sword, the light crashes down upon the monstrous creature. However,
it appears that the monster is unharmed as the light dispels; you must comtinue
to fight the horror.

The spell you just cast was 'Holy Smite,' a spell that will slay, or severely 
damage, any undead creature. However, it does not affect any living or non-
living creature or object, and the night beholder is very much alive. You waste
5 HEALTH in this act.

You still cannot escape.
