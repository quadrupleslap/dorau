-Excaliber
You offer the elves the sword, Excaliber. The elves are extremely excited at
seeing the object, and instantly take it from you. The female elf with the crown
on her head bows to you.
"We will allow you free passage through the forest, if you wish it."
Of course you do. The elves leave, and you feel as if you had been scammed. With
no other option, you continue on your way.
