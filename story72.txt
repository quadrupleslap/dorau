Disorientated, you arrive in an unfamiliar corridor. Unfortunately, two of the
enemy aliens instantly spot you: A miscellaneous person, who happens to look
nothing like them, appearing out of thin air in the middle of a corridor. Of 
course, the two warily move to attack you. You fight them one at a time, in the
narrow interior of this spaceship.
