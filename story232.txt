You continue on your journey North. You seem to be getting closer to where you
need to be, judging from the surroundings around you. However, night comes 
first, and you set up camp near a large lake.

You are woken in the middle of the night by a strange noise. Add 1 LUCK for this
incident, as it inevitably saved you from a watery grave. A tentacle, rising 
from the water, has wrapped itself around your foot; you chop at it with your
weapon, and something shrieks and lets go. However, more tentacles join the 
first, and you back against a tree to face the tentacles one on one.

You fight at 1 less SKILL in the dark. You cannot escape either, as you have 
left all your stuff but your weapon that you hurridly snatched, and the clothes
you were sleeping in.
