You wake up in a room with blinking lights and annoying sound effects. You feel
strong; your body practically glows with power and vitality. (Your SKILL and 
STAMINA has been restored to INITIAL, and LUCK restored by 2 points.) As you sit
up, a 'thing' seems to walk through the wall, into the room. It is humanoid, and
looks almost human, save the gray skin, bald head and three eyes. For a second,
the two of you stare at each other.

"The hero is awake!" it suddenly shouts in a gurgly voice. You realise it must 
be talking about you, as more of these things poke their head through walls,
the floor and ceiling to point their three eyes at you. Another one walks in and
presents you with your possessions.

"Hero, we require your assistance!" it says.
