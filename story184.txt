You wake up. It feels as if you had forgotten something important... but no 
wonder, your head feels as if it had been stabbed by needles.You go down the 
stairs, and consume a hearty breakfast, all free. You restore 2 HEALTH only, 
however, due to your raging headache.

The innkeeper starts to blab about a huge, flying ship, and your headache is so
intense that it doesn't register for a while what she is talking about, before
you realise that the topic is the Sky Pirates!

"In what direction did it go?" you ask.
"Huh? Oh, right... it went Northwards." the innkeeper says.
You instantly pack up, thank your host, and leave. However, before you do so,
the innkeeper presses 4 provisions into your hands. Fame has its uses!

Provisions can be consumed at any time but in combat. Doing so restores 4 
HEALTH. Type 'EAT' into the 'Command' bar to do so.
