Now, we can have fun with your equipment!

EQUIPMENT FOR THE TRIALS AHEAD:
You are dressed in a business suit, tie included, granting you +7 armour saves 
on one die. Upon your wraist is a fashionable watch from the $2 shop. It tells
the time. You carry a NOKIA Brick with the game Tetris upon it in your pocket
(To play this, type 'Tetris' into Google Search, not included here,) and in your
hand you hold a suitcase containing important official documents, of no use. For
battle, you are armed with your trusty American Express Credit Card (Strength 
0.21), which contains upon it $20.00.

You can access your own inventory, and take looks at it, by typing 'INVENTORY'
into the 'Command' Bar. Take a look now.
