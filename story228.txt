You creep slowly towards the deer, as to avoid startling it. You think of deer 
chops, and your stomache growls.

The deer also happens to be thinking of food. As you approach, it seems as if it
is frothing at the mouth. You manage to make out that something isn't right 
before SOMETHING bursts out of the deer, in a replica of the scene from Alien.
It is a green, reptilian creature; the shapeshifter leaps at you, and you 
hastily draw your weapon.

Man, that was really scary.
