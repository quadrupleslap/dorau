NOTES:
The code is probably going to blow up one day or another, but until then 
whatever.
OK, it blew up already. 
PROBLEMS:
When you give a non-enter command at the end of a battle, the game does not 
print out the passage that you need to see in order to continue, does not give
any references.
FIX:
probably add a variable which will show whether it came from the battle screen
or the print story screen, and accordingly do what it needs to do.

# No, scratch the above. Have the story as the main reference, instead of 
printStory, so that story references printStory, not the other way. Either that,
or just replace story function into the printStory place. Rip. Long code coming
