+Staff
You offer the elves the jewel you found upon the ship of the Fyar Nation. The 
elves seem in awe of its beauty, and some even lower their bows in order to 
see the object better. The important elf takes it from you.

"Thankyou for your gift, human." the important elf says. "In return for this
invaluable gift, we elves offer you this."

A hardwood staff appears in her hand, and she offers it to you. It doesn't look
like much, but the staff will help in reducing the strain of spell casting upon
the mind. In the future, when casting a spell, you actually lose 3 LESS HEALTH
than it says so in the passage. However, you will always lose a minimum of 1
HEALTH, as the staff does not negate magical strain.

The elves bow to you as they leave with your gift. In seconds, they have
vanished into the undergrowth.
