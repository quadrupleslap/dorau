You input the words 'ALOHA SNACKBAR' into the system, and the beep this time
signals your success. You enter the room, and the door closes behind you.

The sight before you shall be remembered until you die, which may be soon. A
pulsating blue orb spins within the centre of the room. Around it are series of
switches, bulbs of light and levers. Occasionally, a tendril of light reaches 
out from the strange orb, and seems to adjust its surroundings in a way only it
can understand. This is, undoubtedly, the mothership core!

An automated voice booms out.
"INTRUDER HAS BEEN DETECCTED. DEFENSE SYSTEMS ONLINE."
"ALL GREEN."

You must destroy the mothership core!

Mothership Core SKILL:} HEALTH:19
¤WORLD BOSS¤

The mothership core fights in an unorthodox way. It will, upon winning a round,
continue to increase its SKILL by 1 until it is one higher than yours. Then, the
next round it wins it analyses your weaknesses, before dealing FOUR damage to 
you for every victory!
