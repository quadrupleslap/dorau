A huge mansion seems to have risen up out of the dirt. Built of blackened wood,
it gives off a sinister aura of death and decay. You know, for sure, that this
is the final destination; there will be no unexpected twists and turns, just 
the nitty, gritty stuff. Cautiously, you creep out of your hiding spot within 
the trees, and walk up to the front door. There is a doorbell there, and a 
plaque above reads 'Ring the Butler.'
Do you:
Ring the doorbell? (176)
Open the door? (276)
Look for another way to enter? (317)
