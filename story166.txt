-Suitcase
+Suitcase Blade
You give the dwarf your suitcase. He looks at you as if you have mental
problems, and goes into his home.
"I'll see what I can do."
You hear a lot of smashing and chainsaw noises underground, where he is working
on your new weapon.

It is late when he returns. Your suitcase now sprouts a dagger blade, and a 
strap to hold onto it on one side. It is amazing how ingenious the dwarf is, to
even think of creating such a thing.

The 'suitcase blade' is a sword and shield at the same time. You now 
automatically fight with this weapon, in addition to your normal scimitar. This
grants you a 1 SKILL increase, during battle. Also, if the opponent scores a hit
on you, you have a chance to negate all damage by blocking it with the suitcase
blade. However, this will not be possible against any bosses.

You walk off. Behind you, you hear the dwarf mutter.
"Damn crazy human."
