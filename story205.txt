"In the Second Age, an age long past, an age yet to come, a world dominated by
the dead, those who feared death and... creatures from both above and below, the
Clarent was once again discovered, in a land called Nippon. The sword eventually
found its way into the hands of a Reaper. But then, it was known to all as a 
Shinigami."

"Even the Shinigami, taker of life without warning, was baffled by this weapon; 
why, despite his powers and intellect, was this Clarent GREATER? Why did it 
cause more death and chaos than even death itself?"

"Frightened of this, yet understanding what a valuable treasure it is, the 
Shinigami devised of a plan: to absorb the power of the legendary weapon. But 
despite this, he underestimated the sword; its power being too great, the 
Shinigami was instead consumed by it. Yet, the sudden increase in energy proved 
to be too much for the sword; like a river bursting its banks, the sword 
shattered to its own power, into twelve shards that eventually became the 
Deathnotes. A conditional, smaller 'death and defeat' element. Through knowing
ones true name - their 'defeat', if you will - you are able to grant them 
'death': instant and unconditional."

The Excaliber seems to absorb the silver light, and you can finally see again.
