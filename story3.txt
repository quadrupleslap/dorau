BEFORE YOU START
The path ahead will probably be long and tedious, as you curse RNGesus in
battle, and wander around the labyrinth, slowly dying of hunger. But don't 
worry! We have already prepared your will to your non-existant grandchildren.

Seriously, though, all the choices that you make will affect how this game goes.
This actually goes for most games. We advice that you only begin cheating from
the EIGHTH game or beyond, cause really it's no fun going straight to the end.
Good luck (doesn't count for much when I wish it) and have some fun.
