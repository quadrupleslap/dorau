+Staminade
You take a look around at your surroundings. The man in the white lab coat is
quite dead. Judging from the corpse, it is pretty recent. You spare a word of 
prayer for him.

On the huge table to your left, amongst the various random potions and stuff,
you find a bottle of a substance called 'Staminade.' You read the label. It 
claims that it will 'regenerate health and beauty... etc etc so you can continue
to do what you need to.' You decide to take it. What could just taking such a
substance do to you?

The 'Staminade' can be consumed at any time, even DURING combat. The drink will
restore you to your INITIAL HEALTH when you consume it. What a pickup! Type
'STAMINADE' into the 'Command' or 'Action' bar in order to drink this substance.

You then, out of idle curiousity, take a look at the potions the scientist was
making before his untimely death.
