Ruby Street eventually turns to the right. You turn - straight into a man,
seemingly made of muscle. This individual, upon seeing your suit and tie,
determines that you have money, using his maximum brain capacity to do so. He
decides to pull out a pair of knuckledusters, and you draw your scimitar.

Thug SKILL:8 HEALTH:10

Do you ever wonder why you know everybody else's exact health? Well, I don't
know. You probably don't either.

This battle gives you a chance to ESCAPE. If you ever decide to escape, type 'E'
into the 'Action' bar. However, as you escape, you will turn your back on your
opponent, granting him one last free strike upon you.
