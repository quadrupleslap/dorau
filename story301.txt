You can't stop yourself. You open the door, and go inside.

The room is dark, as there is no light. (Much wow.) A blue curtain is blowing in
the wind of the air conditioning, symbolising sadness, loss, betrayal,
wistfulness.... ok seriously, its just a blue curtain. (YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO
YOUR ENGLISH TEACHERS IN SBHS. REALLY.) There is a huge cauldron in the centre
of the room, and three old ladies dancing around it.
"All hail, Macbeth." the three old hags speak in unison.

Who the hell is Macbeth?
Do you:
Leave the room, closing the door? (435)
Tell them you're not Macbeth, then leave? (764)
Sample some of the soup, tell them its rubbish, before leaving? (632)
