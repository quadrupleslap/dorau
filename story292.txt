You take a swig. After all, what the hell, you already drank some of it. It
feels as if nothing is happening, so you try to take another one. However, you
can feel yourself shaking at picking up a mere bottle. You are puzzled, for 
these wrinkly hands are not yours... are they?

Before you can work this out, you die from brain shutdown, due to old age. The
potion of aging works quite well.
