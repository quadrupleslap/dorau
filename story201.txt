You think hard. Have you met her before... ...?! The one who granted you your
magic! You never did catch her name.
"I am Lilac Moonbeam." she says, as if she had heard your thoughts.

She suddenly teleports, right in front of you. Excaliber floats up from its
place on your back, and falls into her hands.
"The Excaliber..." she breathes.
The Deathnote that was hastily shoved in your pockets a long time ago, and never
used, flutters towards Lilac, as if caught by a breeze. She snatches it out of 
the air with lightning speed and precision. A faint smile plays on her lips.

"Did you know?" she said. "The Excaliber, wielded by Arthur, granted him
absolute victory. Yet it eventually did so at the cost of his life. Its users 
always burn bright, before fading into oblivion."
Lilac turns away. You are rooted to the spot, as if the weight of what she was 
saying was crushing you.
"The Excaliber that you wield is not a complete weapon." she says.
