You offer the elves some of the salted meat. Unfortunately, the meat is space 
pork. Elves considers space pigs to be sacred (only space pigs, normal pigs are
trash) and considers this to be an insult to their race. After a long mental
discussion, they decide to open fire. 

None of the arrows hit the pork.
