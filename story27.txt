"Oh almighty Lord Helix!" you intone. " I beseech thee to appear before thy
unworthy servant to purge evil from this world!"

With a holy ray of light, a minature snow storm, a fall of sakura blossoms and a
sudden flash flood, the great Lord Helix pops into existance! You watch in 
amazement as it waddles out, and is engulfed in dragonfire. However, it survives
the assault without a single scratch, and engages the dragon in a gargantuan
battle.

"Quick!" Shayla says. "While it's destracted, we should enter the portal!"
Your eyes flicker between the dark elf and Lord Helix.
Will you:
	Do as she wishes and enter the portal? (99)
	Or opt to aid the Lord Helix with your suitcase? (137)
