You walk down the corridor cautiously. Bypassing a particularly horrid painting
of an elf being eaten alive by miscellaneous unspeakable things, you kick a 
loose stone.

A round boulder falls from a hidden alcove in the ceiling, and rolls towards 
you. Upon seeing such a huge boulder, you begin to pick up speed, and as if it
is trying to match you, the boulder does so too. This is because the angle of 
the floor is at a 45 degrees incline, but that isn't really that important for
an adventurer about to be going splat.

Up ahead, you see a branch of the main path to the left. It seems like an easy
escape, but you are aware that maybe the creators of this mansion wants you to
go that way.
Do you:
Get in there? (115)
Keep on running like a headless chicken? (341)
