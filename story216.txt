You walk over to the door. Upon it is a plaque, that reads 'Captain's Room.' You
think, 'whatever,' and open the door.

The stench inside is horrendous, and it is obvious what the cause of this is. 
The captain, judging from his fine clothes, is lying on the floor. As you watch,
a maggot crawls out of his eye. The level of decomposition suggests he was 
killed before the crew members by a few days, but by what? Half his face is 
ripped off as well, revealing his skull.

The rest of the room is quite large and comfortable, and beyond the corpse is a
large table, with notes left on top. Yet it is not the time for this, as the 
body twitches before your eyes, before getting up. Pulling down a scimitar 
hanging from the wall, it rushes at you with an un-zombielike speed!

Zombie Captain SKILL:9 HEALTH:6

This zombie is obviously more skilled than his zombie friend you met earlier!
You may escape in this battle, if you wish.
