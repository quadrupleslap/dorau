Emerald Avenue is a huge street dedicated to the protection of nature and all.
Many satyrs and dryads live here, tending to rediculous rose gardens. As you 
swagger down the centre of the road like they do in the movies, a voice calls to
you.
"Hey, you!" 
You turn, and see one of the satyrs beckoning you over.
"Help me over here, and I will make it worthwhile for you!"
Will you:
Aid him in whatever he is doing? (75)
Ignore the horned creature? (92)
