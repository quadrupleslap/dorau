The door is locked. However, after you rattle the door for a bit, it falls like
a drawbridge into the room you are trying to enter. Oops.

After seeing such dark colours around you for so long, the gold is almost
blinding. Golden tables, golden chairs, golden tea sets, golden shelves, and a
statue of a girl in gold. The room's only inhabitant is an old man. He wears a
gold crown, and his clothing is, interestingly enough, golden rags.

"Help... me..." he croaks out, and reaches out to touch you.
Do you:
Allow him? (145)
Back off? (233)
