The room is large, and covered in a disgusting organic substance, like that on
the door. Eggs of unknown creatures, as large as you, cover almost every single
surface of the room. A woman sits in the middle of the room. At least, you 
assume it is a woman. Her clothing, a brown carapace, seems as if it was part of
her own body, and two bony, bat-like wings fan out from her shoulder blades.
Dreadlocks fall down to about shoulder height, and purple eyes are revealed as
she turns to face you. The person stands up.

Claws extract from her fingers, and you can tell she is not exactly friendly. 
You draw your weapon.
"Foolish Terran," she snarls, "I am the Swarm. Armies will be shattered. Worlds
will burn. Vengence shall be mine."
"For I... AM THE QUEEN OF BLADES!"
With that, she leaps at you, and you prepare yourself for the creature known as
'Kerrigan.'

Kerrigan, Queen of Blades SKILL:13 HEALTH:21
¤WORLD BOSS¤

Kerrigan is truely a fearsome foe to face in combat. Her two wings mean that she
is allowed to strike twice for every one strike you make. This means that she 
can attack twice per turn. The first round you fight as normal, but you can only
parry the second round, and cannot do any damage, even if you win.

You may, and probably should, escape. (Tips from the author.)
