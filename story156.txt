You decide to brave the mountains. You never liked forests anyways. Too many
trees. And elves.

The going is quite tough, and it gets colder the higher up you go. You begin to
think that this was an extremely bad idea. This is confirmed when what you 
previously had thought were just a pile of rocks rose up, and takes the shape of
a boulder beast. You must fight it!

Boulder Beast SKILL:9 HEALTH:10

You cannot escape; the climb down is far too treacherous, and you don't want to
risk falling down!
@Floater& However, you can use the floater, if you wish, to escape!
