You enter, eyes only on the potential treasure. However, as soon as you place 
both feet in the room, the door behind you slams shut. Water begins to trickle
out of the corners of the ceiling, and you gasp as the illusion is finally 
dispelled. The chest is dull and rusted; skeletons litter the room, probably 
other victims of such blindness and inability to see blatently obvious traps.
You hammer upon the door; it is locked. Your only hope may be to charge the door
down in a situation like this. (No, you cannot pick the lock. You're going to
drown, damn it!) You take a large run up, and give it your all at breaking the 
door.
