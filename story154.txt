You, to your luck, manage to somehow identify a number of non-poisonous edible
plants, mostly fruits. You even suprise yourself by killing a small thing 
resembling a chicken! You hope this food won't go bad on your journey.
Altogether, there is enough food for 3 provisions.

Provisions can be consumed at any time but during combat, and each restores 4
HEALTH. Type 'EAT' into the 'Command' bar whenever you wish to consume one 
portion.

You return to the path by following the trail of destroyed flora, and offer a 
silent prayer to the old dude you met earlier, in the hopes that he did not see
this act.
