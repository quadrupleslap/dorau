The room you enter is just, or even more, lavish as compared to the other. A 
red velvet sofa adorns the centre of the room. A fireplace takes up the Western
wall, and amazing tapestries decorate the rest of the walls. A table, directly
infront of the sofa, holds empty plates and bowls. There are two doors, the one
you entered by, as well as one to the North.
Do you:
Return to the main hall, and climb the stairs? (215)
Open the other door? (341)
