You spend the next hour on planting roses, sweating profusely under the sun.
Lose 1 HEALTH for such a strenuous task. Lol.

Eventually, as the last rose is planted into the ground, you look up at the 
satyr again, to find that he is holding two items. In one hand is a magnificent
sword, crossguard and pommel of gold, inlaid with precious diamonds and 
emeralds. In his other hand, he holds... a pen. A ballpoint pen, to be precise.
"Choose," he intones. Is it just you, or is his voice deeper?
Now, do you pick:
The sword? (44)
Or pen? (88)
