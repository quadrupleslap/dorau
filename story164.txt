-Excaliber
+¤Excaliber¤
His eyes get even wider upon seeing Excaliber. He takes it, and grunts.
"A bit heavy, ain't it?" he says. "Lets see what I can do about that."
He returns to his home, a hole well hidden by greenery, upon the side of the 
mountain. Before long, you can hear the sound of hammer upon anvil, with a good
variety of dwarvish curses being muttered from time to time.

It is almost dark when the dwarf returns. In his hands is Excaliber. He offers
the weapon back to you, and you are amazed at how light the sword is, after 
taking a few practice swings.

You will, from now on, use the 'Excaliber' in combat, rather than your scimitar.
Excaliber grants you an EXTRA 2 SKILL bonus in battle. This can even go over the
INITIAL SKILL limit. As the 'Sword of Victory', when facing against overwhelming
odds, Excaliber will reflect your determination. For that, when facing an 
opponent with higher SKILL than you even with this bonus, Excaliber helps by 
granting ANOTHER 1 SKILL bonus, in addition to the previous, taking it to a 
bonus of 3 SKILL.

Humming happily from this trade-off, you walk off.
