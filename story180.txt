You push your way to the front ruthlessly, and see a horrid sight. A person, 
bearing the skull and crossbones of the Sky Pirates, is collapsed on the ground
in an awkward position. A brave villager feels his neck for a pulse, and shakes
his head.
"Dead." he solemnly proclaims.
Contrary to these words, however, as if just to prove the villagers wrong, the 
pirate suddenly stands up. With glassy eyes, it shambles towards a group of 
people near you. Instantaneously, the villagers begin to chaotically run, 
screaming at the top of their lungs. It is up to you to face this zombie, and 
save these hapless villagers!

You cannot run; you'll probably get trampled! (And who else will save these
villagers?)
