Arcane symbols and incantations float within your head. You feel powerful like
never before!

Now, whenever you fight within a battle, you have the ability to cast magical 
spells. In a fight, unless otherwise specified, you may type the word 'MAGIC'
into the 'Action' bar to use it. However, magic is not without its risks; it is 
taxing upon body and mind, so you will lose anywhere between 1 to 8 HEALTH when
casting a spell. Also, as you are a complete novice with no training in the 
magical art whatsoever (putting it off as petty sleight of hand and superstition
before this) your spells could potentially be very random, doing something 
unexpected or even threatening. It is advised that you use magic with care, as 
it can be only used once per fight.
