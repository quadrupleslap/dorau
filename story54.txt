+*Mariner's Crossbow*
You wait, unsure of what is going on or even how to respond to this old man. He
looks at you with hollowed eyes, and speaks.
"Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
As idle as a painted ship
Upon a painted ocean..."

By the time he is finished, you are stunned by his hardships for just shooting
an albatross. The man looks relieved; he pulls a glowing crossbow from the air,
and offers it to you. You have no choice but to accept it. Smiling, he walks 
off, leaving you. You resolve to never shoot an albatross, lest you befall the
same fate. You continue Eastwards.
