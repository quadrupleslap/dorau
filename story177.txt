+Provision
You visit the essentials store. The store is packed with objects, such as rope,
helmets, mirrors and pickaxes. However, what you notice is in abundance is the
amount of food. The owner comes over to you, and upon seeing your sword, guesses
that you are on an adventure or something.

"Here," he says, handing you some food. "Take this for free. We have too much."
You are almost moved to tears by such kindness. You can eat provisions anytime,
but in combat, by typing 'EAT' into the command bar. Each portion restores 4
HEALTH, and the shopkeeper gives you 3 portions. You thank the shopowner 
gratefully, and leave.
