+¤Queen of Blades¤
What the hell? You actually killed Kerrigan? Did you, like, set your SKILL to
9001 or something? You massive hakk3r.

Anyways, as you slay the Queen of Blades, the title is transferred to you.
(No, even if you are male, you still gain the 'Queen of Blades' title.) You 
feel... absolutely normal. Your reward for defeating this impossible enemy is a
useless title.

Slightly (Very?) disappointed, you return to the corridor.
