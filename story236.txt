The journey East is uneventful, save for one instance. As you proceed across the
sand, your newly-aquired Osiris' Sight detects movement underground. You leap 
backwards, and just avoid the maw of a mighty sandworm as it rises up to devour
you. You slash at it... only to find two more maws rising at your side. Fight
them one by one!

Damn, this is a really unfair fight! Yet you cannot escape, for you are 
surrounded by these things. So why arn't they attacking you at the same time?
