It is an albatross. You feel yourself moving; but it is not your own movements!
You raise the Mariner's Crossbow, until it is level with the bird. A sharpened
stake is in your left hand; you do not know when it got there. You load it, and
fire. To your dismay, it does not miss. The final curse of the Ancient Mariner
has come into effect; for this act, you are doomed to roam the world as a half
spirit. Purpose forgotten, you wander off into the distance.
