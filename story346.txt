Shayla could not have possibly survived that. You know, because you see a glint
of gold in the dirt near you. Crawling over to it, you find that it is the One
Ring. So it is true that the Ring is almost indestructable, even to time itself.

The ring whispers dark secrets to you as you bury it, but you somehow resist
with an iron will. You are sure somebody will find its burial place in the 
future, but most likely in a distant future where you are long dead.

Rain pours from the heavens, as you howl in despair.
**THE END.**
