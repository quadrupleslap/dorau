You go right. Unfortunately, the footsteps that were approaching came from that
direction. The path goes East for a while, before turning North. As you turn the
corner, you see three aliens advancing towards you. You almost panick, and 
attack, before remembering the cloak that makes people invisible. As the aliens
approach, you can hear their heated discussion of a recent game of Dungeons and
Dragons. The corridor is too narrow for you to squeeze past them without them
noticing, so....
You can either:
Back off, going North at the intersection. (75)
Back off, going West. (192)
Attack! (222)
