You continue attempting to open the door through various methods. Unfortunately,
unknown to you, the door has a self defense mechanism. Upon failing 3 attempts
in a short period of time, spikes will protrude from door, floor, ceiling and
walls. This is how you met your end, upon the alien spaceship of the Fyar 
Nation.
