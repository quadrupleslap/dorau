-Scimitar
+¤Scimitar¤
The dwarf takes your scimitar. A hole in the ground is revealed, and he climbs
in. Before long, you can hear the sound of hammer on anvil.

Shortly, the dwarf returns, with the promised weapon. The weapon shines with a
wicked sharpness, and when you press it upon your thumb, a drop of blood comes
out. The scimitar will now deal 3 damage per hit in battle, or five on a heavy
strike.

You thank the dwarf, and walk off.
