+Gatorade
The path runs around the hills, and you decide to follow this useless path, in 
fear of becoming lost. Soon, however, you come to a fork. The path runs two
ways forward, one to the North-East and one to the South-East. The South-Eastern
one passes into a forest, while the one to the North-East seems to trail up a 
mountain. You secretly think that the topography of the land around you is sort
of screwed up, or maybe your Geography teachers were just messing with you. 
You still, however, believe that you should follow one of the paths, as your
chance of being lost just increased exponentially.

Before you have to flip a coin or something, however, you see a glint in the
grass, and you decide to inspect it. It is a sports drink that somebody 
presumably dropped. 'Gatorade' is what it is labeled as, and you pick it up. Due
to the innate nature of sport drinks, you can drink it at ANY time, even DURING
COMBAT, and additionally will restore your Health to its INITIAL value. When
you want to consume this, type 'GATORADE' into either the 'Action' or 'Command'
bar.

Now, you have put off this incredibly difficult decision for a while, but:
Go North-East, towards some mountains? (1)
Go South-East, towards some forests? (2)
