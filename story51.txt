As you strike the last, killing blow, the Ancient Mariner disappates like sea 
foam. You can hear the words 'thank you' as he finally leaves the world, and is
blown away in the wind. You gain 1 LUCK for this act. However, the anchor that

right before your eyes, that glows a magical green. Do you wish to pick the 
object up?
