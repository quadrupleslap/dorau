You wake up, and feel completely invigorated. Your HEALTH and SKILL have been 
restored to their INITIAL values. An alien, a Portatore, is standing next to
you, as if on guard. He notices that you have awakened.

"Thankyou for your act, hero." it says. "Many of us would like to meet and 
congragulate you, but you did mention you were on an important quest. (When was
this..?) We have prepared, however, a few gifts to show our gratitude."

Another alien walks in through the door, and offers you your inventory. You 
notice that both the cloak and door jammer are gone. However, the first alien
then holds out two items for you to take.

The first is a ring, with a blue jewel embedded within. You slip it upon your
finger, and the gem glows.
"That object is a Ring of Healing. Using nanotechnology, the ring will aid in
repairing your body when you heal. (Whenever you regain HEALTH for whatever 
reason, the ring will heal you for one more than it otherwise would, but not
over INITIAL.)

The second item is a drink. You look at it with a bit of mistrust. What is this?
"This is an item a previous hero left for us." the alien says. "We are.. um...
not sure what it does, but you should take it with you."
You may drink the liquid at any time but in battle, with the command 'ALD.'

"Thankyou, hero. Goodbye!" the alien says as you are transported to another 
location.
