You step onto the yellow brick road. The road glitters. You follow it along in 
an almost dreamlike state, or to be more accurate, a dope-like state. Sparkles 
fly up whenever your foot comes down on the road, and you behold this in wonder.

A thing appears as you begin to lose all track of time. What were you doing 
again...? The thing turns out to be a scarecrow. You dance around it for a 
little while. Its eyes begin to glow. You pull out your weapon. It pulls off one
of its arms, and uses it as a sword. You charge. It charges too. You must face 
this scarecrow doppleganger.
