You leap upon the mountain goat, and end its life with a well-placed slash to
the jugular. For the rest of the day, you prepare the animal, and at night you
build a fire and eat some. You regain 4 HEALTH.

In the morning, you add the cooked meat to your suitcase. You have enough 
servings for 3 meals. You can consume provisions at any time but in combat by
typing 'EAT'. Each serving will restore 4 HEALTH to yourself. You get up, and
continue onwards.
