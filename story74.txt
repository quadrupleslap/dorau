You breathe heavily from the effort. Did anybody hear you? Just to be safe, you
put on the cloak that makes people invisible. Your brain finally starts working
again (must have been the fried mirror demon) and you realise that the quest
given to you was very vague... what are you actually meant to do? How will you
ever get back?

The door jammer suddenly begins to flash, and you almost drop it in suprise. A
message begins to play from the object. Static pierces the voice.

"Hero, you must destroy... mothership core.... then go to...... transport you 
back........"

The rest is drowned out in static. You bang the object on the ground, but 
nothing is fixed.

Your hearing begins to pick up footsteps approaching, and you quickly turn off 
the jammer, by spamming all the buttons. 

From now on, it is advised that you draw a map. This place can get a bit 
confusing pretty quickly....
Now, will you go:
Forward? (75)
Left? (192)
Right? (267)
