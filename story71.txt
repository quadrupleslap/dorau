You agree and the creatures cheer. Instantly, and for the rest of the day, the
room is a flurry of activities, with every second Portatore wanting to thank you
and offering you many... interesting... foods such as the grubstopper soup and 
fried mirror demons, an apparent delicacy upon their planet. Unfortunately, not
all the foods actually agree with your stomach, and you lose 2 HEALTH from 
stomach pains.

The next day, you prepare to depart upon your adventure. The creatures, give you
two items to carry upon your mission: a cloak that is supposed to make you 
invisible, and a device that is said to hack doors systems upon the Fyar
Nation's ship.

"Prepare to be transported!" You walk into the machine that is meant to 
transport you into the enemy ship. Gradually, you become see-through, and the 
location around you shimmers and changes.
