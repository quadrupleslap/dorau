+Winged Helmet
You step into the room cautiously, testing for tripwires, trapdoors, switches,
laser pointers and other things. Nothing seems to happen, so you enter, and put
on this magnificent helmet. Add one LUCK for this find.

This helmet is a Helm of Floatation. It will gently float you down any fall. 
However, being a helmet, it does have protective uses. There is a slight chance,
against any non-boss entity, that this helmet will cause them to deal 1 less
damage than stated. This does not stack with other protection.

With your new helmet, you leave, and go down the corridor.
