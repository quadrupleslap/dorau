The room you are in would give you epilepsy, if you were a lesser person. From
floor to ceiling, it is plastered with flashing lights all in different colours
that continously change. In fact, there are flashing images projected directly
from the walls themselves, too, just to make you have a brain seizure.
You squint, and pinch yourself in the face. You are not dreaming! There is an
item that is floating in the middle of the room!
Do you:
Grab the item? (4)
Go North? (99)
Go South? (56)
