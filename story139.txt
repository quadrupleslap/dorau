You opt to enter the forest. You never liked mountains. Too many dwarves.

Almost overwhelmed by the nature around you, the going is tough, but you 
prevail, hacking at vines and branches that seem intent on blocking your way.
Sweating, you finally make it into what could be called a clearing. There is a
lake here, and you greedily dring at it, not even stopping to consider such good
fortune. It is only when you look up that you feel as if it may have been bad
luck in disguise.

An old man, in a cross-legged position, levitates above the water. You can 
swear he wasn't there when you first entered the clearing. His hair and beard
are all a tangle of vines, and as he opens his eyes, to your shock you notice
that they are empty, only sockets.

"You who desecrates the forest," a loud booming voice intones. The old man's 
mouth stays closed throughout the whole sentence. "Who invades land not
belonging to him, and thinks nothing of destroying life within it, I offer you
two choices; your eternal servitude to the forest around you, or a game where
your life is the wager."

Well, the choice seems obvious.
