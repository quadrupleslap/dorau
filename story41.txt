You come to the end of Emerald Avenue. A huge gate is just... there, signifying
the end of the city. Huh.

Two guards stand in front of it. Unfortunately, they are very awake. As you 
think about how to deal with them, one of them calls out.

"Oi, you exiting the city or not?"
You blink. "Don't I need a passport or something?"
"Don't be stupid. Now hurry up."
Hardly believing your luck, you walk out through the gates, into the vast 
beyond.
