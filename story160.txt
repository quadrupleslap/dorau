After a little bit more of journey progression, no rocks leap up to attack you;
rather, a short, stocky humanoid, wielding an axe, seems to come from the rocks.
"Oi, you!" he says, rather rudely. "This is dwarf territory! You want to 
proceed, then pay up!"
The dwarf probably has dwarf buddies to back him up. In this situation, you 
decide it is probably wiser to just pay up.
Do you:
Offer him your American Express Credit Card? (20)
@Prism& Offer the jewel you found on the spaceship? (229)
@Booze& Offer him the booze? (266)
