Word shall travels fast in this tiny town. The innkeeper, upon seeing your 
person, rushes out to greet you. For the first time in a while, you feel truely
like a hero. Your stay is free, courtesy of your act of bravery.

"Sorry, hero, I didn't get your name," says the innkeeper.
"Just leave it Blank. (])" you reply.

After a long night of drinking, as everybody buys you beer, you finally retire
to the bedchamberes provided to you.
