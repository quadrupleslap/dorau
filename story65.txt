"Alright!" she cheers. "Finally, a person brave enough to fight the golden bull!
Wait a second, I'll get us there."
You do not have time to utter even a single word of protest before she waves her
hand, and the two of you are instantaneously trasported to another location. The
creature sitting eight metres before you is a huge golden bull. It's muscles 
glisten in the sun, and it turns its head to look at you. You gulp.
"Good luck!" the girl whispers. When you turn your head, she is not there.
The bull stands up, and shakes her head. It points two lethal horns at your 
body. You consider running, but you don't even know where you are. You pull out
your scimitar.
