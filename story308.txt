You cast a random spell. This spell saps you of energy, and you lose the maximum
8 HEALTH for it. In this moment, you are unable to dodge, and King Midas touches
your face. All is over.

Or not. Confusion shows on both your faces as nothing happens. Where is the
famed 'Midas Touch?'

Behind him, the golden objects shimmer, before they are suddenly restored to 
their original forms. The door, table, tea set, rags, all revert to their 
original materials. Yet the girl remains golden. Midas turns around, and upon 
seeing that she is still an unmoving statue, breaks into sobs.

Yet this was not meant to be a tragedy.

The gold cracks, a multitude of thread-like lines spreading all over the object,
before shattering, revealing a flesh-and-blood version double of the statue
underneath. The girl opens her eyes, still alive after such a long imprisonment.

For such an act (however accidental it was) the gods look down upon you with 
kindness. Restore 5 HEALTH, and your SKILL and LUCK back to initial. Leaving
the two in an emotional moment, you slip out.
