You stride Northwards, with purpose, determination and your brand new backpack.
Due to your headache, and partly also due to the unimaginable strain on your 
mental functions ever since you set off on the path of a hero, you are almost 
delirious. In fact, you even begin to talk to your backpack. Now, if you had a 
map and a monkey with boots...

Engrossed completely in this act, (despite the backpack not replying) you don't
notice the assassin following you, apart from the constant crackling of sticks,
rustling of leaves, swearing and sniffing at short intervals. You spin around to
face him. You notice it is a her. You spin around to face her.

Incompetant Assassin SKILL:8 HEALTH:7

The assassin wields a knife. It will hurt if she goes stabby stabby with it. 
(Did the innkeeper slip some weed in your breakfast or something?) You cannot 
use magic; you can't even think straight, let alone cast a spell. You really 
can't escape. Come on, it's an incompetant assassin, for god's sake!
