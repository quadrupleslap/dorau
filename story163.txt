-Prism
You offer the sparkling jewel to the dwarf. His eyes widen in amazement as he 
takes the gem.
"Th... thankyou!" he stutters. "This is... truely beyond what you needed to 
pay!"
He paces around a few times, before seeming to come to a decision.
"I will, if you wish, enhance any one of your weapons for you, in exchange for
this gemstone. After all, let nobody say that dwarves are not fair and 
trustworthy people!"

What do you wish to enhance? Do you:
@Excaliber& Enhance the Excaliber? (411)
Enhance the scimitar? (118)
Enhance the... suitcase??? (9)
@Mariner's Crossbow& Enhance the crossbow? (344)
Refuse his offer, instead moving on? (202)
