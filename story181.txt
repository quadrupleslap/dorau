You strike the final blow upon the cursed creature, and it falls to your 
attacks. Upon its death, the shambling corpse, as if in contact with acid, 
rapidly is 'eaten away,' until it is no more.

The villagers, you find, have stopped running around like idiots, and are 
instead now applauding, as if you had slain a dragon or something. Some random
little kid lays a bunch of flowers at your feet. You ask around for the 
direction in which the Sky Pirates went, but it seems nobody knows. You decide,
instead, to retire to the local inn.
