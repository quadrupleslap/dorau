You climb the stairs. No gargoyles attack you this time. It is quite uneventful,
and you get to the top without a single trap triggering.

However, once at the top, you find a suit of black armour blocking your way.
There doesn't seem to be anyone in there, as it would have already seen you and
attacked if there was. Despite this, when you place your leading foot upon the 
third floor, the visor of the Western-styled armour glows blue, and the same
ghastly light shines out from joints in the armour. The animated obstacle pulls
out a lance from one of the walls.
"None shall pass." it states.
You charge this suit of armour, and it raises its lance in reply.

You cannot escape in this instance. Where would you go, down the stairs again?
