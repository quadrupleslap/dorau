Ah, East! A good decision! In the East is the Shaolin Temple, dedicated to 
creating monks and martial artists. If you had about 10 more years, you could
have gone there and learnt the drunken panda style, using your force palms to 
destroy the criminal organisations around the world. But that's wishful
thinking.

Instead, about two hours later, you see an old man striding towards you in the
distance. As he gets closer, you hear him muttering "I shot the albatross" over
and over again. You avoid eye contact, and try to bypass the obviously crazy old
man, but he places a hand upon your shoulder.
What do you do?
Shout "Unhand me, grey-beard loon!" (11)
