You notice that you are getting close to the 'X' on the map, but that it would
require you to veer in a North-Western direction. Casting one last glance at the
deer, you walk off in search of this treasure.

The further East you go, the better the surroundings get, to the point where 
there are even birds in the trees. You conclude that the monster which destroyed
the Sky Pirates is causing the land to die around it. However, what is more 
pressing right now is the trek. It is long, and despite you staying hydrated the
temperature seems to rise. It takes more than a day to get there, but during the
night it is freezing, and you lose 3 HEALTH. Your suit was not made for this!

In the morning, you continue. Such a detour takes you away from Shayla, and you
are worried that you may be taking too long. As such, you push yourself. At
noon, tired and out of breath, you gaze upon your destination.
