You concentrate. This is it!

Heavenly wings spread from your back, and you rise to the sky. The clouds
covering the stars thin, then disappear altogether. Light condenses in your 
outstretched hand.

The dragon roars, and a stream of necrofire flies at you. You fling the light
head-on at the fire. This light splits, forming a myriad of brilliant swords.
Together, the blades descend upon the unholy creature, slashing through the 
necrofire, and raining down Judgement.

You float back to the ground, and your wings retract. Lose 3 HEALTH for this
spell only. Upon inspection, the 'Holy Smite' has become the unique spell
'Judgement', a power granted only to you.
