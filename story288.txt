Most of the various things the scientist was doing is unfinished, but you see
3 potions that seem to be complete. The first one is yellow, the second one is
red, and the last one is clear and colourless. None of them are labelled, and 
you are not sure if you should drink any of this, or if you should just go up
the stairway to your right.
Do you:
Try the yellow potion? (79)
Try the red potion? (53)
Try the colourless potion? (27)
Just go up the stairs? (346)
