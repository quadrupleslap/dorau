You cannot bear the thought of killing the dark elf. You decide to abandon the
fight, and begin to run from her.

"Wait!"

You turn, despite knowing that this could be a huge mistake. Shayla has taken
off the ring; all her anger, hate and arrogance is gone, and you could almost
fool yourself into thinking that she was the same Shayla that you had met at the
beginning of this adventure.

Shayla speaks.
"I've thought about it for a while. My new goal is to rule this world; but by
myself, I cannot do that."
She then proposes her intent to you.
"Join me."

You think about it. Right now, you are an adventurer, but what happens next?
What do you do when this is all over? You don't have any commitments; no jobs,
no money. Taking over the world sounds, in comparison, quite exciting.

You accept the dark elf's offer. She smiles, and reaches out with her hand.

You take it.
